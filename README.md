Mordred Feature Analysis is a project taken to understand and analyze the difference between the concentrations of Chemical Stimuli and their effect on the clusters of cortical activity in the mouse OB. It goes together with mordred_ae, a simple package that can help run the autoencoder in Mordred Feature Analysis.
The Code_Olfaction_Thesis is the jupyter notebook for the main part of the code for the Paper. With Distance Matrices and Mantel Tests being the R code part of the analysis that produces the distance matrices for the notebook.
